    GET /q/queuename
        gets an object out of the queue

    DELETE /q/queuename
        purge and delete the queue

        basic statues about all the queues.

        queue.

    It's possible to create delayed jobs (eg: job that will not be run
    before a defined time in the futur).

        curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST "http://localhost:5002/q/foo?delayed="$(expr `date +%s` + 500) -d '{"key":"value"}'

    the delayed value should be a date in epoch
